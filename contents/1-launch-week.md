It has been a week since RemoteCoder [launched on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8464074) and I'm pleased to say that we have already helped companies find and hire great developers for their roles. We've also received plenty of feedback and enquiries of interest into our plans for the future. 

Over the past week we've already made a number of improvements and additions to the site:

* **RSS feed** - we now have an [RSS feed](http://feedpress.me/remotecoder) of all of our jobs, and this feeds into our [twitter feed](https://twitter.com/remotecoder).

* **Keyword search** - users can now search jobs by keyword on the front page, leading to better filtering.

* **Email address confirmation** - when creating a new job ad we now confirm the user's email prior to publishing.

* **Email message improvements** - we've made improvements to the email templates used to send candidate applications, job confirmations, etc.

* **Marking ads** - if there are any issues with the criteria of a particular ad we can now mark it as _under review_ whilst we investigate further.

* **Blog** - what you're looking at!

* **Legal docments** - we've added [terms and conditions](/terms-and-conditions) and a [privacy policy](/privacy-policy).

In addition to the above we've incorporated feedback from users such as enforcing visible company names and even fixing the HTML background image in-place for better visual scrolling.

Going forward our priorities are to keep serving our existing userbase and build our readership base of high quality programmers and companies. With these in mind we are currently working on adding:

* **Articles and interviews on remote working** - we would like to interview both companies who hire remotely and developers who work remotely, in order to engender greater understanding of the benefits and challenges of this style of work.

* **Filtered RSS feeds** - at the moment we have a single RSS feed. Soon we aim to enable customized RSS feeds based on the filtering criteria that matters to you.

* **The Wall** - a little _experiment_ (more on this in a later post...)

As we add more features and content over the coming weeks we will begin marketing RemoteCoder through further channels.
