_We chat with Emily Ruzzo, the Mentor Manager at [Thinkful](http://www.thinkful.com/) - an online education startup - about remote hiring and working practices at her company..._

**Hi Emily and thanks for joining us! To start off, please tell us a bit about Thinkful.**

Thinkful is a company is that delivers career development skills online. We've just done web and mobile development so far, but we're branching into design and UX, data science and a bunch of other really interesting areas. We provide that skill training to students who can pace themselves whilst working on learning new concepts with one-on-one mentorship.

**Cool. And how long have you been running as a company?**

We're just approaching our 2 year mark.

**Just to be clear, students pay for the courses. That's basically the business model, right?**

Yes it's a subscription model. Students pay by the month for access to the curriculum and mentorship. So there's definitely some incentive built in there for them to keep themselves on target.

**I guess we can move onto talking about the team. How many remote vs in-house colleagues do you have at Thinkful?**

We have about - and this is almost current numbers, it wasn't this way 2 months ago - we have about 30 folks in-house right now and 220 mentors around the globe.

**And what was the reason for Thinkful to start hiring remotely in the first place?**

I don't know for sure. But I do know that we really want to have a global reach. We think there's no reason with this educational model to not be able to do it internationally.

**I see. And in terms of the mentors who are working remotely, where are they based? All over the globe?**

Yes, literally. Actually I recently made a joke regarding our mentor newsletter 2 weeks ago. The campaign monitor software that we now use to see whether people are reading our emails or not gives a world view - a map - of where everybody who has opened the email is. It was so cool to look at because I spend all day talking to these people and I could see a dot almost everywhere on the map. Except that we made a joke that we could definitely increase our mentor presence in Mongolia!

**(Haha!)**

**So from the sounds of it, because mentors arrange their working hours themselves, it's pretty flexible in terms of what timezones people can be in, what hours they can choose to work with students. Would that be a fair assessment?**

Yes, totally. They can completely pick their own timezones. Our mentors get to determine their own schedule 100%. I think that's part of our appeal to them.

**Ok. And what sort of tools do you use to collaborate at Thinkful? And is there a particular tool that everyone's plugged into throughout the day?**

We use a lot of Google collaboration tools - docs, hangouts, etc. We're big on Slack right now. We love Slack. We actually aren't too prescriptive about the tools our mentors use. We trust their judgement to use Screenhero when it's appropriate, Codepen when it's appropriate, etc. Whatever they feel is the best tool to serve their student is ok by us.

**Are your mentors mostly freelancers or are any of them actually employees of Thinkful? Do you actually have any remote employees?**

We currently do not have remote full-time employees. It's actually becoming an interesting debate. I wouldn't be surprised if we did soon.

I surveyed the mentors a couple of months ago. They're contracted with Thinkful but it turns out that 50% of them do freelance work and about another 40% of them had full-time jobs outside of Thinkful.

**My next question was going to be about whether you encourage remote employees to come and visit HQ, but I'm not sure if that's as relevant now.**

Actually we do. It's not fair to everybody but we have lunch together as a team. We sit down and eat lunch together twice a week. Which is amazing because it's a room full of workaholics - all dedicated people - but they actually walk away from their computers to sit down and share a meal together, which I love.

Anybody who's visiting is welcome. For example, one of our mentors from San Diego was taking their in-laws to New York. They came in for lunch the other day. Anybody who's in town should come and join us!

**Cool!**

**In terms of working with people remotely, what have you felt has been challenging? What are the main challenges, if anything?**

Timezones. I actually think the biggest challenge right now is scheduling. We're not yet big enough to have full distinct regions. Everyone still needs to interact with us at some point. 

But I actually like to not think about the challenges of remote work, and this is not Thinkful's stance, this is my stance. I've done this before in another organisation. I just believe that when we're delivering a remote product - which we are as an online service - we don't have any business being in that area if we can't engage our team just as well wherever they are. I like to think that the way I interact with our mentors is the way they interact with our students.

**Ok. And is there anything you'd like to highlight for potential mentors of Thinkful? What would help them do it better from day 1 in terms of remote working?**

This is a really basic one but I'm surprised that it happens. Check your internet connection and tools ahead of time. Check that your Hangout works before you start the interview.

I honestly think if you enjoy what you do and you've appreciated somebody giving you that knowledge you will tend to come up here and become a great mentor. You won'd be intimidated by distance - physical location will not be an obstacle to the transfer of knowledge. I think that's so cool.

**Great, that wraps it up. Thanks a lot!**
