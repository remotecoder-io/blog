_We chat with Mohammad Forouzani, the CTO of [Fanwars.com](https://www.fanwars.com/) - an exciting fantasy sports startup - about remote hiring and working practices in their company..._

**Tell us about Fanwars. What is your business?**

We're a daily fantasy sports company. It's a web app - people sign up and they can play against other people, betting on who they think the top players will be. They'll build an "A-team" and then pit that team against other people's teams. Whoever gets the most points based on real-life games wins that contest. And then we give out real cash prizes. 

That's basically what we do. And we're based in Las Vegas. 

**Do you focus on particular sports?**

Right now we're just NFL-based but we will be expanding to NBA and MLB very soon. And in the future maybe golf and some other sports as well.

**Ok. And - you say you pay out cash prizes - what's the business model there?**

So we're very similar to other daily fantasy sports contests. The model is that we're the market-maker. We bring people together and we take a cut. To enter a lot of these contests you would normally pay in cash. You deposit money into our system and you can use that to enter various contests. And there's an entry fee. 

So for example, if 10 people enter a contest and the entry fee is $2 then the total prize pool will be $20 (10 times 2) minus our percentage take as a market-maker, which is usually around 10%. And that's industry standard. The winner - if it's only 1 winner - would take away $18 and we'd keep $2.

**And how long have you been running this business?**

It's been going for a year-and-a-half, maybe a couple of years now. It's been in the making so we're quite new actually - we're only a few months old in terms of launch. And we're basically rebuilding the whole system and we've got some big news coming out shortly which I can't reveal right now. But yeah, there are a lot of things in the works which we're going to be launching soon.

**Onto your team now. How many people do you have working remotely vs in-house in Las Vegas?**

In terms of tech we only have a couple of people here in Vegas. Right now we have 3 or 4 people working remotely, and we're looking to build that out and hire some more as well.

**And where are they based, your remote colleagues?**

They're pretty much global. We've got one guy in Poland, one guy in Iran. We've got some other people as well and they're based in various places. There needs to be some overlap so that collaboration can occur, meetings, etc. We try and be agile so there are daily stand-ups and other things that require a team presence. We do have core hours that everyone needs to attend but that's only a few hours. We're pretty flexible with our remote teams. Whenever they feel like or prefer to be working - that's upto them.

**And what tools do you use to collaborate? Is there a particular one that's more important than the others?**

Our main tool is really Skype. We have chatrooms setup. For project management we use JIRA which is a pretty popular product. Those are the key tools. For the tech side we use Git. We're using Github right now but we could use any hosted Git repository. Yeah, I think those are the only tools we're really using right now.

**Ok. Do you have freelancer and contractors working for you? Or is everyone an in-house employee?**

We have a mixture. Some contractors, some in-house. But the thing is our codebase is quite complex. So even the contractors come on-board with the intention to be with us over a long term. We don't really do short-term contracts.

**And for the people working remotely who aren't contractors, do you provide them with equipment or the budget to purchase equipment that they need? Or is it more of a bring-your-own thing?**

No it's pretty much bring-your-own. Depending on how things go we do plan to have certain perks. We might fly them out to Vegas to spend some time with us. Or there might be group meetings in some other countries where we might do all-expenses-paid. But in terms of equipment we expect the people who we're hiring to already have everything setup. We aim to hire more senior developers. We're not aiming at the graduate/junior level. Senior developers are going to have their development environment setup anyway.

**Ok. And I think you answered my next question regarding whether you encourage people to visit HQ.**

Yeah, we actually have an office here in Vegas. And it's a pretty big office. It can accomodate anybody that we find that wants to come visit. Actually we would prefer that. We would prefer to hire locally and have everybody in the same office but the reality is that here the talent pool isn't big. Especially in open-source technologies. Vegas is more geared towards Microsoft and Oracle - that type of tech stack which we're not using. Which means that talent is very very limited. 

It's not really a budget issue, it's more of an availability issue. In terms of senior open-source developers available for work there are very few of them in Vegas.

**In terms of all the remote work that you've had going, what do you feel has been the biggest challenge, at least maybe initially?**

I've worked with a lot of remote teams in the past and the main challenge is always the same. It's always communication. It's all about having someone you can rely on, who's going to turn up to work daily, who's going to attend the core hours. Everybody has excuses for why they can't turn up to work.

Even in an office environment where people have to come into the office you'll still find people occasionally making excuses for not coming in. But when it goes to remote work that's just ten-fold or even hundred-fold. The number of people that you find you can rely on to just be present and give it their all - I think it's much lower. I think the reason is that remotely you facilitate distractions. You're at home, where the kids are running around, the mailman arrives, or you need to call the plumber...there's the opportunity to be distracted.

So I think communication is the biggest issue. We're an English-speaking company so we've decided that regardless of where you are - even in various parts of the world where the native language is not English - we expect very good English from our developers. Because that communication just has to be there.

**For people who want to work with you remotely, apart from communication, is there anything you'd like to higlight?**

Not really. I'm pretty flexible. If they want to take a day off - if it's a religious holiday or national holiday for them, for example - that's fine. Again, it comes down to communication. They need to let me know beforehand that they need to take time off. If the day comes and they send me a message and I was relying on them to hit some target, but they can't because they've decided to suddenly take off, then that's a problem.

I think being transparent with developers of what you're expectations are is important too. I think that comes down to management. Which actually leads me to my next point. This is very difficult stuff to try and assess but you need to hire people remotely who don't require micro-management. Because you're just not there and you can't hold their hand all the time.

Someone who's going to have initiative and who's going to make decisions on their own, even if those decisions may sometimes be wrong. Because you may not be online when they're working and you don't want them to be blocked by a decision.

**That's quite interesting. I've been working remotely for a while but I hadn't really thought it through that much from a manager's point of view.**

**That's pretty much it in terms of questions actually. Thanks so much for speaking with us!**
