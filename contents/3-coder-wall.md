I am pleased to announce the launch of the [Coder Wall](/coders) ! Check it out and [let us know](https://twitter.com/remotecoder) what you think.

The intention behind the Coder Wall is to showcase top remote developers along with links to their work. Developers can signup and create a mini-profile for themselves and then update it at their leisure. We want to keep the quality of the wall high so we will be vetting each profile individually. 

We also wish to interview developers who work remotely - to gain more insight into their lives and find out what makes them tick. From a developer's point of view it will also help to provide a more human side to their coder profile. If 
you'd be interested in doing an interview with us then please do [get in touch](https://twitter.com/remotecoder).

We would like to build RemoteCoder into a community of developers who support each other working remotely and maybe even meet up. We are thinking of adding a forum or some other messaging board to this effect and would love to hear your thoughts on this. 

Any feedback is much appreciated!
