_[Guillaume Chéreau](https://remotecoder.io/coders/guillaume-chereau-168) is a remote developer currently based in Taipei. We catch up with him to find out how we got started as remote coder..._

**Please go ahead and introduce yourself...**

My name is Guillaume Chéreau and I'm from France. Right now I'm working and living in Taiwan, in Taipei city.

**And what's your speciality? what languages do you code in and for what platforms?**

I mostly do Android and iOS development but not using the normal languages like Java and Objective-C, but mostly using only C or C++.

**So you build your own apps?**

Yeah, but my background is in embedded devices so I'm more used to lower-level languages like C. So what I do is I write everything in C and then compile it for Android or iOS.

**How long have you been working remotely?**

It's been more than 2 years now.

**How did you get into remote working? what made you start doing it?**

I work on an open-source project called [Stellarium](http://www.stellarium.org/), and my brother is the main developer behind it. And he had this idea of doing a mobile-phone version of it so we did that. At the time it was for Symbian and we won a contest. We got some money - I think it was €25,000 - and we thought maybe there's a business in this. We decided to start a company doing that, so I quit my job and started to work full-time on this project. 

The company is called [Noctua Software](http://noctua-software.com/). Originally we just worked on Stellarium, but we've since done some freelancing work and built some applications as well.

**You work through a company - is that registered in France?**

It's registered in Hong Kong actually.

**Cool. And in terms of working remotely, what are some of the challenges you've faced?**

The biggest challenge is waking up early.

**(Haha)**

Seriously, it is! 

**To stick to the schedule that you're setting yourself.**

Yeah exactly. I tend to work late sometimes. It depends on my mood. Sometimes I work late but if I want to write a lot of code I have to wake up early. If I have some difficult problem to solve then I will stay up late. But the next day I won't be able to wake up early so I won't be very productive. It's a bit difficult to deal with that.

**You said you've done some freelance work for clients. Where are your clients normally based?**

The first clients I got - right when I started my company - were in Taiwan. They were doing some kind of social application.

**And you were in Taiwan at that time.**

I was in Taiwan. And I went to China for them. Then I got two clients from France, South America, America and another one in Taiwan. For one of them I worked for more than year, in Taiwan. Lots of my clients actually wanted me to work on Stellarium, but I got a few other unrelated projects too. I worked on a Reuters application in Taiwan. I did some embedded software for devices, stuff like that.

**Ok, good stuff. For anyone else who's looking to start working remotely is there any advice you can give them?**

It's hard to answer this question because I think it depends on what kind of software you do. I don't do web development, for example. And I guess most of the freelancers I've met do web stuff.

In terms of general challenges, my biggest problem at the beginning was that I didn't keep track of anything I was doing. So I didn't keep track of when clients had to pay me, I often lost invoices, etc. Now I'm much more organised - I scan every document I get. I think you need to be more a lot more organised than when you were just coding. So it's a bit hard at the beginning. At the end of the first year when I had to the annual report for my company it was crazy - I couldn't explain all my income because I didn't have all my invoices. It was really hard. You have to very organised, especially for accounting purposes.

**That's a great tip. I'm sure other people can relate to that.**

**Well, thanks for giving us this interview, it's been great talking with you!**

You're welcome!
